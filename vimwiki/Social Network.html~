<ul>
<li>
Small world: the principle that we are all linked by short chains.

<li>
Stanley Milgram in the 1960s found that the median length is six.

<li>
Work by D. Watts and S. Strogatz in Nature'98

<li>
Like a routing algorithm, use local information to find efficient paths (decentralized routing scheme).

<li>
Subtle variant of the Watts-Strogatz network will support efficient search - add links that decays like the dth power of their distance (in d dimensions), rather than add long range random shortcuts.

<dd>Using a complete \(b\)-ary tree \(T\). Let \(V\) denote the set of leaves of T; \(n\) denote the size of \(V\); \(h(v,w)\) denote the height of the least common ancestor of \(v\) and \(w\) in \(T\). A non-incerasing function \(f()\) , that for each \(v\) create a random link to \(w\) with probability proportional to \(f(h(v,w))\). Create \(k\) links out of each node \(v\) this way. Results in a graph \(G\). Edges and non-leaf nodes of \(T\) does not appear in \(G\).</dd>
