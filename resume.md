## Work experience

#### 2012	*Data Mining Intern*, @Tencent(QQ) Inc.

- **Unveiling the Unique Features of Tencent Weibo**

Used Hadoop to process collected data of more than 320M users and 3.7B microblogs on a cluster of 36 servers. Studied Tencent Weibo from both macro and micro levels, discovered interesting difference between Tencent Weibo and Twitter.

- **User-level Microblog Recommendation based on Semi-Supervised Algorithm**

Our group proposed a Factor Graph based microblog recommendation algorithm TSI-WR (Topic-Level Social Influence based Weibo Recommendation), outperformed several baseline methods. Responsible for data cleaning in the group.


## Professional experience

#### 2013	*Bachelor thesis*, @EE, THU

- **Greedy forwarding for mobile social networks embedded in hyperbolic spaces**

Designed and evaluated a novel greedy message forwarding algorithm using metrics in hyperbolic spaces, obtained competitive performance in terms of message delivery ratio and cost. Poster presented in SIGCOMM'13.
#### 2011	*Course project*, @EE, THU

- **Terrain Classification Based on Wavelet Method**

Used locally stationary wavelet as a feature extraction method for classifying Brodatz textures. and Google Earth data.

- **Music Transcription Using Gaussian Mixture Model and Beat Detection**

Used beat detection (based on constant Q transform) and maximum likelihood estimation for music transcription.
#### 2010	*Course project*, @EE, THU

- **Test and Evaluation of Background Extraction Algorithms**

Implenmented some background extraction algorithms using C++, analyzed the applicabilities of each algorithm in varied conditions.

- **Vocabulary-building software**

Designed an application using MFC and XML, integrated multiple words lists and dictionaries, aimed to enhance memorization speed.
