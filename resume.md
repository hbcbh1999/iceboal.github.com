## Work experience

2012	*Data Mining Intern*, @Tencent(QQ) Inc.
- Unveiling the Unique Features of Tencent Weibo
  - Used Hadoop to process collected data of more than 320M users and 3.7B microblogs on a cluster of 36 servers;
  - Studied Tencent Weibo from both macro and micro levels, discovered interesting difference between Tencent Weibo and Twitter.
- User-level Microblog Recommendation based on Semi-Supervised Algorithm
  - Our group proposed a Factor Graph based microblog recommendation algorithm TSI-WR (Topic-Level Social Influence based Weibo Recommendation), outperformed several baseline methods;
  - Responsible for data cleaning in the group.


## Professional experience
