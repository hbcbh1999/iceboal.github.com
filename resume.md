## Education

- **MSc in Computer Science, 4.0**, **Columbia University**, New York (2013--)

_Machine Learning Track_

- **BSc in Electronic Engineering**, **Tsinghua University**, Beijing (2009--2013)





## Work experience

#### 2014	*SDE Intern*, @Amazon

- **Feed and Report Platform Daily Flash**

Use various AWS services and visualization techniques to automatically generate daily report of the usage of Amazon Marketplace Feed and Report Platform services, and provide a web portal for users to customize their daily email report.

#### 2012	*Data Mining Intern*, @Tencent \& THU

- **Unveiling the Unique Features of Tencent Weibo**

Used Hadoop to process collected data of more than 320M users and 3.7B microblogs on a cluster of 36 servers. Studied Tencent Weibo from both macro and micro levels, discovered interesting difference between Tencent Weibo and Twitter.


## Academic experience

#### 2014	*Research project*, @CS, Columbia U

- **Word semantic representations using Bayesian Probabilistic Tensor Factorization**

Introduced a Bayesian probabilistic tensor factorization model for synthesizing a single word vector representation and perperspective linear transformations from any number of word similarity matrices. Evaluated the word embeddings with GRE antonym questions, achieved the state-of-the-art performance. Paper accepted by EMNLP'14, project will be integrated in IBM Waston.

#### 2014	*Research assistant*, @CS, Columbia U

- **Extracting the Social Network of the Taliban (ongoing)**

Using natural language processing technique to perform social event extraction over a large tranche of newspapers and magazines produced by Taliban, aim to construct a mapping of the social network of the Taliban leadership.

- **Mention Network in the Enron Email Corpus**

We introduced a novel mention network from emails, then demonstrated such network can help perdicting the organizational dominance in the Enron corporation.


### Representative projects

- Acoustic bird species recognition app on iOS device (will be integrated in Birdsnap).

- Use Machine Learning to help Kinsa Inc. building their theormometer app.

- Greedy forwarding algorithm for mobile social networks embedded in hyperbolic spaces.

- Terrain classification based on wavelet method.

- Music transcription using Gaussian Mixture Model and beat detection.
