## Education

- **MSc in Computer Science, 4.0**, **Columbia University**, New York (2013--2014)

_Machine Learning Track_

- **BSc in Electronic Engineering**, **Tsinghua University**, Beijing (2009--2013)





## Work experience

#### 2015	*SDE*, @Amazon

- Joined the Feed and Report Platform Gateway team in Amazon Marketplace.

#### 2014	*SDE Intern*, @Amazon

- **Feed and Report Platform Daily Flash**

Used various AWS services and visualization techniques to automatically generate daily report of the usage of Amazon Marketplace Feed and Report Platform services, and provide a web portal for users to view and customize their daily report.

#### 2012	*Research Intern*, @THU \& Tencent

- **Unveiling the Unique Features of Tencent Weibo**

Used Hadoop to process collected data of more than 320M users and 3.7B microblogs on a cluster of 36 servers. Studied Tencent Weibo from both macro and micro levels, discovered interesting difference between Tencent Weibo and Twitter.



## Academic experience

#### 2014	*Research project*, @CS, Columbia U

- **Fast, Flexible Models for Discovering Topic Correlation across Weakly-Related Collections**

Developed two probabilistic topic models, Correlated LDA and Correlated HDP, for analyzing topic correlations between large, asymmetric, and potentially weakly-related collections. Used C-LDA to compare over 300k documents in collections of sciences and humanities research from JSTOR.


- **Word semantic representations using Bayesian Probabilistic Tensor Factorization**

Developed a Bayesian probabilistic tensor factorization model for generating word vector representations and per-perspective linear transformations from any number of word similarity perspectives. Evaluated the word embeddings with GRE antonym questions, achieved the state-of-the-art performance. Paper presented in EMNLP'14, project will be integrated in IBM Waston.

#### 2014-	*Research assistant*, @CS, Columbia U

- **Role Discovery based on Email Corpus**

Developed an application of semi-supervised learning that utilize Author Topic Model and graph Laplacian to automate role discovery with a small amount of training data.


- **Mention Network in the Enron Email Corpus**

We introduced a novel mention network from emails, then demonstrated such network can help predicting the organizational dominance in the Enron corporation. Implemented graph walk and re-ranking algorithm for name disambiguation.


- **Extracting the Social Network of Taliban**

Used natural language processing technique to perform social event extraction over a large tranche of newspapers and magazines produced by Taliban, aim to construct a mapping of the social network of the Taliban leadership.



### Representative projects

- Acoustic bird species recognition app on iOS device.

- Used Machine Learning to help Kinsa Inc. building their theormometer app.

- Greedy forwarding algorithm for mobile social networks embedded in hyperbolic spaces.

- Music transcription using Gaussian Mixture Model and beat detection.

## Contest Awards

- 2014	**Amazon Global Intern Hackathon (Computer Vision)**

  Rank 4th / 73 teams   

  

- 2013	**Kaggle Contest: Multi-label Bird Species Classification - NIPS 2013**
